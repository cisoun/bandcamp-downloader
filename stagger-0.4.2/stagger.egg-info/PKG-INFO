Description: 
        The ID3v2 tag format is notorious for its useless specification
        documents and its quirky, mutually incompatible
        part-implementations. Stagger is to provide a robust tagging package
        that is able to handle all the various badly formatted tags out there
        and allow you to convert them to a consensus format.
